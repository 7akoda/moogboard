# MoogBoard

A React-based interactive project that bridges the world of music and climbing. Inspired by the holds of the 2019 MoonBoard, it transforms climbing routes into unique musical compositions. Each hand-drawn SVG corresponds to a real MoonBoard hold and interacts with a moving line to produce music when a "collision" is detected, akin to the piano roll detection in DAWs like Ableton or FL Studio.

With 18 chords and 4 instruments, some climbs may create more harmonious compositions than others.
